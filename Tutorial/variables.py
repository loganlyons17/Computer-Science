# variables store information

player_health = 100

# this sets the player's health to 100

enemy_damage = 10

# what does this do?

#You can also do math with variables.

new_player_health = player_health + enemy_damage

print(f"Player has {player_health} health")
print(f"Enemy deals {enemy_damage} damage to the player")
print(f"Player now has {new_player_health} health")

# can you fix the bug?

# variables can come in different forms.

# there are integers (whole numbers), floats (decimals), and strings (text).

# A string is stored in a variable by using quotes.

player_name = "Wesley"

# strings can be combined with other strings using the + operator.

adjective = "cool"

## print(player_name + " is " + adjective + "!")

# strings and integers can be combined using what is called an f-string.

## print(f"{player_name} has {player_health} health!")

# This has been a crash course on variables.
